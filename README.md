Developing software should be accessible to anyone that has access to the internet and a modern web browser. Here I will document the software I use to make that a reality.

For a few years now I have done all of my development work inside a docker container. My home machines run various flavors of arch linux (manjaro). My development docker container uses alpine, and in production I bounce between Arch, Ubuntu, and Alpine. At work I use macOS.

My favorite VPS providers are Vultr, Digital Ocean, and Contabo.
